ODE TO A QUEUE
by
Leonard Kleinrock

In the 20 years of funding
Many fields has DARPA led.
But the finest thing that they did bring
Was the analytic thread.
  
By that I mean they nurtured
Quantitative research tools.
And they always felt for all their gelt
They got principles and rules.

Indeed a wealth of knowledge
Was uncovered and was new.
And the common thread with which we led
Was the analytic queue!
 
Now a queue may have one server.
If there's more, they form a team.
Its dearest wish is just to fish
In a quiet Poisson stream.

If you want to model networks
Or a complex data flow
A queue's the key to help you see
All the things you need to know.

So the next time you feel lonely
And wonder what to do,
You'll soon feel fine if you join the line
Of an analytic queue!
